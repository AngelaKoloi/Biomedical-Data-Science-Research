# Mental Health-Enhanced CVD Prediction Using GANs and Machine Learning

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Work%20in%20Progress-orange)]()

**Psychological Factors for Improved Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Prediction**  
*A Machine Learning-based Study Using Lifelines and UK Biobank Data*

## üìå Key Findings (Preliminary)
- **Prediction Improvement**: Mental health data increased AUC from 0.88‚Üí0.94 (Lifelines) and 0.76‚Üí0.83 (UK Biobank)
- **Key Psychological Predictors**: Childhood trauma and somatic depressive symptoms (fatigue, sleep disturbances)
- **Model Efficiency**: Symptom-level vs sum score models showed comparable performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

### 1. GAN Components
**Objective**: Generate synthetic mental health-CVD data for augmentation

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `generator.ipynb` | GAN architecture for synthetic data generation |
| `real_synthetic_comparison.ipynb` | Quality assessment of generated vs real data |

### 2. Machine Learning Pipeline
**Objective**: CVD risk prediction with mental health integration

| File | Analysis Stage |
|------|---------------|
| `ML_merged.ipynb` | Main prediction model (XGBoost/RF/SVM) |
| `outliers.ipynb` | Anomaly detection in feature space |

### 3. Preprocessing Modules
**Objective**: Cohort data harmonization

| File | Functionality |
|------|--------------|
| `data_preparation.ipynb` | Merging/cleaning multi-source data |
| `convertions.ipynb` | Feature engineering:<br>‚Ä¢ Smoking status conversion<br>‚Ä¢ Childhood trauma scoring<br>‚Ä¢ Symptom sum scores |
| `stats.ipynb` | Cohort descriptive statistics & hypothesis testing |

## üéØ Research Objectives
1. Quantify mental health's added predictive value beyond traditional CVD risk factors
2. Identify most predictive psychological features through SHAP analysis
3. Develop demographic-adapted models (Lifelines vs UK Biobank)
